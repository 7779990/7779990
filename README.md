## Abstractica
Abstractica is a decentralized synthetic liquidity protocol that supports the creation and trade of synthetic assets on Algorand. Abstractica users will be able to generate synthetic asset which tracks the price of an external asset through the over-collateralization of ATCA – Abstractica’s own token. Abstractica allows investors and traders to take advantage of the price changes of any asset without having to store them in their wallets. This brings traditional financial instruments to the Algorand DeFi sector, increasing its versatility. At this current stage, Abstractica’s focus will be on synthetic commodities and cryptocurrencies.
